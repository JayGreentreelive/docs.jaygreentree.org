# ZoomIt

The ZoomIt allows you to embed an image viewer on the public and administrative items/show pages of your Omeka Classic site, allowing your users zoom in and around images.The plugin relies on an beta service from Microsoft, [Zoom.It](http://zoom.it/).

This plugin relies on an external service and it may render or load differently in different web browsers. It also relies on the [Silverlight](http://www.silverlight.net/) browser add-on, which some of your users may need to upgrade to experience the full functionality of zooming.
