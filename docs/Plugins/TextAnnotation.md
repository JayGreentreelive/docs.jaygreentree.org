# Text Annotation

The Text Annotation plugin allows users to annotate HTML text on Omeka Classic sites using either the [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) or [annotateit.org](http://annotateit.org/) webservices. 

*Please note* that as of March 2017, annotateit is not longer taking new accounts; if you are installing Text Annotation, please use hypothesis.

## Configuration

From the plugin's configuration panel, either of the services can be chosen. Click the one you would like to use and press Save Changes.

## Using Text Annotation

Visitors to your site can now annotate pages by highlighting text and typing into the corresponding dialog boxes. If users do not have accounts with hypothes.is or annotateit.org, they will be prompted to create one.

Once annotations have been added, pages will display them via highlighted text which can be hovered over (hypothes.is) or clicked (annotateit.org) to reveal the notation.

For more information about how the annotations will appear, and how they function, please see the website for the service which you select.
