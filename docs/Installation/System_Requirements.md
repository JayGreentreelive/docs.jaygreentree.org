# System Requirements

Omeka Classic has the following system requirements:

-   Linux operating system
-   [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) HTTP server (with `mod_rewrite` enabled)
-   [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) version 5.0 or greater

## If your server does not meet these requirements
-   Try [Omeka.net](http://omeka.net) hosting
