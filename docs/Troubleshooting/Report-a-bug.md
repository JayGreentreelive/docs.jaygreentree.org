# Report a Bug

Bugs are errors in the system. If you find a bug in your Omeka Classic installation, please let us know.

## Before Reporting a Bug
Always check to see if it has already been reported. You can search the [forum](http://forum.omeka.org) and our [github repositories](https://github.com/omeka) to see if the bug you have found has been identified.

## Who Posts Bugs and Where
Users of varying technical skill will report bugs in different places. 

We encourage novice users to post bugs to the [forums](http://forum.omeka.org) if they think somethings broken, but don't know why.

Users who have an interest in hacking and developing code with Omeka, Power users and developers can report bugs directly as issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/omeka). Sometimes these bugs affect the core of the software, and sometimes they require basic modifications to a user's theme or plugin. Please use the correct repository for the bug you are reporting.
