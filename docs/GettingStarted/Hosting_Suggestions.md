# Hosting Suggestions

If you lack access to a server that meets Omeka's [basic requirements](../Installation/System_Requirements.md), try our [Omeka.net](http://omeka.net) hosted service.

The Omeka Team offers fully managed, [isolated hosting](http://omeka.org/about/services/), which includes installation and updating of the core software and any themes or plugins developed by the Omeka Team, and direct technical support.

Hosting companies that use [Installatron](https://installatron.com/) should offer a one-click install of [Omeka Classic](https://installatron.com/omeka). Hosting companies that use [Softaculous](https://softaculous.com/) should offer a one-click install of [Omeka Classic](https://www.softaculous.com/softaculous/apps/educational/Omeka) and [Omeka S](https://www.softaculous.com/softaculous/apps/others/Omeka_S).
