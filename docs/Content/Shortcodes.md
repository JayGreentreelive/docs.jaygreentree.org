# Shortcodes

Shortcodes work in text fields in specific places on Omeka Classic sites: on [Simple Pages](../Plugins/SimplePages), and in the text fields of [Exhibit Builder](../Plugins/ExhibitBuilder)Exhibit Page blocks.

*Note:* This page is a user’s guide to shortcodes. For developer documentation, see [Working with Shortcodes](http://omeka.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Tutorials/shortcodes.html) on Omeka’s Read the Docs site.

For shortcodes for Plugins, see the [Plugin Shortcodes](../Plugins/Plugin_Shortcodes.md)

General
--------
Shortcodes can be added into html text fields. The general syntax is
   `[shortcode key=value]`

Values can be wrapped in single or double quotes, making the following variations valid as well: `[shortcode key='value']` or `[shortcode key="value"]` **Please note** that shortcodes will not work with smart quotes. 

If the shortcode results in an image display (from an item or file), the shortcode will use the Omeka default of displaying the filename or Dublin Core title as alt-text. 

When using shortcodes on a SimplePage, you should not use the "HTML editor" option. Put the shortcode in the basic text field:

![A Simple Page text field with lorem ipsum and a featured carousel shortcode](../doc_files/shortcodeSimplePage.png)

When using a shortcode in an Exhibit Builder block, place the code directly into the text editor:

![An exhibit page text block with a file shortcode plugin.](../doc_files/shortcodeExhibitBlock.png)

### General Shortcode Options
Most shortcodes have options which can modify the content they return. The following table explains some of the options which are shared across multiple shortcodes. 

Options specific to a shortcode can be found in its own section. 

| Option | Purpose | Settings | Example |

### File
The file shortcode will return a file of a specified ID.

The shortcode is `[file]`. It will not function if it is not provided a file ID.

Options:

`id` (*required*): specify the ID number of the file you wish to retrieve; see below for instructions on how to find the ID number. For example, to get the file with the ID of 362: `[file id=362]`

`size` specify the image size for image files

*Options:*
- `thumbnail` - thumbnail version of the image
- `square_thumbnail` - a squared and centered thumbnail of the image
-  `fullsize` - the fullsize version of the image

`link_file`  specify whether to link the file to it’s file show page; default is ‘1'

*Options:*

- `1` or `true` - links to the original file 
- `0` or `false` - removes all links to the file 
- `thumbnail` - links to the thumbnail file
- `square_thumbnail` - links to the square thumbnail file
- `fullsize` - links to the fullsize file

`width`: specify the pixel width of the audio or video player; available for most audio and video types; defaults vary.

`height`: specify the pixel height of the audio or video player; available for most audio and video types; defaults vary.

####  Examples

To return a thumbnail of an image, that links to the original file, with the file ID of 5:

    [file id=5 size=thumbnail]

To return a square thumbnail of an image, that links to the fullsize image, with the file id of 12:

#### Find the File ID

To find the file id navigate to the admin page for the item it is attached to; for example http://youromekainstallation.com/admin/items/show/482.

At the top of the Item page is a list of the files associated with that item. Clicking on one will bring you to the file page; for example http://youromekainstallation/omeka/admin/files/show/752. 

At the top of the page is a header containing the file ID \# and file title; for example File \#752: "The File Title". The integer following the \# sign is the ID; in this instance it would be 752. To return this file, the shortcode would be `[file id=752]`

## Plugin Shortcodes

### Exhibit Builder
These shortcodes require the [Exhibit Builder](../Plugins/ExhibitBuilder.md) plugin.

#### Exhibits
The exhibits shortcode will return one or multiple exhibits.

The shortcode is `[exhibits]`. Without additional options, it will return ten exhibits, beginning with the oldest one.

General Options

- `num`
- `ids` 
- `is_featured`
- `sort` by 
  - `title`
  - `random`
  - `added`
- `order` (with sort)

Exhibit IDs can be found at the end of the Edit page url for an exhibit; e.g. yoursite/admin/exhibits/edit/11 -the exhibit ID is 11.

#### Featured Exhibits 
The featured exhibits shortcode will return one or multiple exhibits that have been marked as featured.

The shortcode is `[featured_exhibits]`. Without additional options, it will randomly return one exhibit from all of the ones marked as featured.

General Options:
- `num`

### Geolocation
The [geolocation](../Plugins/Geolocation.md) shortcode will create a map of items based on parameters it is given.

The shortcode is `[geolocation]`. Without any additional parameters, it will return a map of all items that contain geolocation data, limited by the records per page as set in the Geolocation plugin configuration.

**Options**

`fit`: specify whether to allow google map to automatically center and zoom the map to fit all of the markers. This is on by default.

To manually specify the map/location zoom, use the following options. Note, to use these options, fit must be set to ‘0' or ‘false'.

`lat`:  specify the latitude of the map’s initial center point, in degrees. Must be between -90 and 90.

`lon`: specify the longitude of the map’s initial center point, in degrees. Must be between -180 and 180

`zoom`: specify the initial zoom level of the map. 0 is the most zoomed out.

If any of `lat`, `lon`, or `zoom` are not specifically set, and ‘fit' is set to `0` or `false`, the settings from the Geolocation plugin configuration page will be used.

`type`: specify the type of google map that appears. Defaults to the setting from the Geolocation plugin configuration page.

*Options:*

- roadmap - displays the road map view
- satellite - displays Google Earth satellite images
- hybrid - displays a mixture of road map and satellite views
- terrain - displays a physical map based on terrain information

`collection`: limits the map’s items to those from a specific collection, using the collection ID number. Only one collection may be specified. For example: `[geolocation collection=5]`

`tags`; limits the map’s items to those from a specific tag. Multiple tags can be entered, separated by a comma, and without any spaces. For example: `[geolocation tags=baseball,math]`

`height` set the map height. Can be set in pixels or percentages, but requires specification with either px or %; defaults to 436px. For example: `[geolocation height=300px]` or `[geolocation height=50%]`

`width`: set the map width. Can be set in pixels or percentages, but requires specification with either px or %; defaults to 100%. For example: `[geolocation width=200px]` or `[geolocation width=75%]`

#### Examples

To print a map of all geotagged items, simply use: `[geolocation]`

For a map that gets all of the items from your first collection, that are also tagged ‘baseball'. Ex. `[geolocation collection=1 tags=baseball]`
 
A shortcode that leveraged all of the possible parameters would look like `[geolocation lat=42 lon=117 zoom=7 type=hybrid collection=4 tags=baseball,math,oakland height=500px width=500px]`

### Shortcodes Carousel

Requires the [Shortcode Carousel plugin](../Plugins/ShortcodeCarousel.md).

The plugin adds a shortcode to create a carousel of items using [jCarousel](http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/)

The basic shortcode is `[carousel]`.

`[recent_carousel]` and `[featured_carousel]` are shortcuts to
creating a carousel of recent and featured items, respectively.

The same options available for the [Items](#items) shortcode are available for the carousel, with the exception that `has_image` is always assumed to be true.

**Options**

`speed` sets the speed for the scrolling animation. May be "fast", "slow", or a time in milliseconds. Default is 400. For example: `[carousel speed=slow]` or  `carousel speed=500]`

`autoscroll`: setting autoscroll=true will make the items automatically scroll interval. When autoscroll is on, interval sets the interval between scrolling in milliseconds. Default is 3000. For example: `[carousel autoscroll=true interval=700]`
