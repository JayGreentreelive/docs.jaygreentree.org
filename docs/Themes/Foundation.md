Installation

For basic out-of-the-box use of the theme, follow the Omeka Classic User Manual instructions for installing themes.

For more advanced use, such as customizing the theme with Sass, you'll need to install the tools with NodeJS (0.12 or greater). Navigate to your theme directory and run npm install.
Theme Configuration

    Stylesheet: The theme provides 4 style options.
    Default uses ZURB Foundation's default styles for prototyping, which are all viewable in their documentation under the Kitchen Sink.
    Revolution aims to capture the feel of old documents and juxtaposes it with a bright red accent. It includes a textured paper background image.
    Sea Foam offers a clean, friendly look with a teal palette.
    Inkwell features a high contrast serif family for its typography, as well as sunny yellow accents.
    Navigation layouts: Global navigation can display as a horizontal top bar with optional dropdown menus or a left vertical column.
    Show Top Navigation Child Pages: Toggle display of child pages within the main navigation.
    Logo: Upload an image asset to use as a logo in place of a text site title.
    Footer Content: Control what appears in the footer. This field takes HTML markup.
    Layout for Browse Pages: Select how to display items within their "browse" views.
    Grid: Items are organized into rows and columns. This is recommended for items that prominently feature images.
    List: Items are stacked into a single column.
    Toggle (default: grid): Site visitors can choose to display the browse views as grids or lists, and grids are the default.
    Toggle (default: list): Site visitors can choose to display the browse views as grids or lists, and lists are the default.
    Layout for Show Pages: Resource metadata can show display as stacked with properties as headings above their values, or inline with properties as headings inline with their values.

Customizing the Theme

For those dipping their toes into customizing sites with CSS, the CSS Editor module allows site administrators to write style overrides.

For advanced CSS and Sass users, Foundation S uses ZURB Foundation Site's toolkit that includes variables and mixins for managing and extending many styles.
Sass Tasks

Run these commands within the theme's root directory.

    npm start: While this task runs, it watches for changes to sass files and recompiles the CSS.
    gulp sass: This is the one-off task for compiling the current Sass/CSS.

Sass File Structure

Foundation S comes with the Default theme, as well as 3 other customized stylesheets that were built on top of Default. The "Sea Foam" theme has the fewest overrides and is thus the easiest reference for a custom theme model.

/asset/sass/seafoam.scss

@charset 'utf-8';

@import 'globals-default';
@import 'globals-seafoam';
@import 'settings';

// Sea Foam Settings

$topbar-background: $primary-color;

$thumbnail-border: 4px solid $secondary-color;
$thumbnail-shadow: none;
$thumbnail-shadow-hover: 0 0 6px 1px rgba($primary-color, 0.5);

$button-background: $secondary-color;
$button-color: $primary-color;

@import 'foundation-core';
@import 'omeka';

header a {
  color: $white;
}

Much of the customizability within the theme lies in managing its settings variables. ZURB Foundation's default global variables from their original _settings.scss all sit in _globals-default.scss. Many of these variables are used throughout the rest of _settings.scss, so it was necessary to separate them out into their own file if the theme writer wants to set their own global variables. Here all the overrides live in _globals-seafoam.scss, and so all overridden values will be appropriately updated for use throughout the rest of _settings.scss.

Any non-global setting variable overrides should come after the import for _settings.scss and before their usagee in the rule files, _foundation-core.scss, and _omeka.scss.

ZURB Foundation's default style rules are all managed in _foundation-core.scss. All style rules specific to Omeka S are contained within _omeka.scss.

After all those imports come all style rules specific to the theme.
