# Big Picture

This is the documentation for using "Big Picture", a theme for Omeka Classic. This project is part of a collection of image-centric themes designed for art historians and educators in mind.



The item pages utilize the Chocolat lightbox plugin. It supports the following features:

    Zoom and pan: If the image is larger than the lightbox container, clicking on the image allows for zooming and panning around it.
    Full screen: Have the viewer take up the full screen using the full screen icon icon in the lower right corner of the viewer.
    Manual slideshow: The left and right arrows in the viewer enable manual cycling through images. This also works with keyboard navigation.




Header and Footer

The theme supports an uploaded Logo File that replaces the site title text in the header. The logo will display at a maximum height of 32px in the header, meaning that if the uploaded logo file has a height larger than 32px, it will be scaled down automatically. By default, the header uses a black background, so transparent logos with light colors look best.
Home

The homepage uses Omeka's "featured" flag as the source of its content. Featured content displays in the following order: featured exhibits, featured collections, and featured items. There are settings to toggle off any type of content (Display Featured Item, Display Featured Collection, Display Featured Exhibit). Within each content type, the ordering is random. Featured content that does not have an associated image uses a solid gray background.

The rotating carousel on the home page displays the featured content grouped by type in the following order: exhibits, collections, and items.

Homepage Text provides a space for including introductory text. This text appears in a large text area underneath the featured content carousel.
