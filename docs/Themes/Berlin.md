# Berlin 

![The homepage with some default settings.](../doc_files/theme_images/Berlin1.png)

The Berlin theme: 

- Uses a dark blue theme colour on white and grey backgrounds, with an orange link highlight. 
- Constrains your webpages to 960px in width. This can be overridden using custom CSS to change the `header` width, `content` div width, `primary-nav` div width, and `footer` width. 
- Displays the site title or logo at the top left of the screen and a search bar on the right.
- Displays website pages in a row of rectangular tabs across the top of the main content area. 
- Provides a text area to provide footer content.
- Will display your logo image at 480px maximum width, and constrain the height proportionally. A banner-shaped logo is recommended, at 480px wide and 100px tall. 
- Will display a header image at a maximum width of 960px.




!!! note
	Even if a theme does not offer an customization option on its Configuration page, you can still modify how your website looks and behaves using the [CSS Editor plugin](../Plugins/CSS_Editor.md). This can include text, header, link, and background colors, the widths and heights of elements, borders around elements and images, the size of text, and the ways that logos and header images display.
