# The Daily

This is the documentation for using "The Daily", a theme for Omeka Classic. This project is part of a collection of image-centric themes designed for art historians and educators in mind.

The item pages utilize the Chocolat lightbox plugin. It supports the following features:

    Zoom and pan: If the image is larger than the lightbox container, clicking on the image allows for zooming and panning around it.
    Full screen: Have the viewer take up the full screen using the full screen icon icon in the lower right corner of the viewer.
    Manual slideshow: The left and right arrows in the viewer enable manual cycling through images. This also works with keyboard navigation.

Colors

The theme allows color options for the following elements:

    Button and link background
    Button and link text
    Featured content background color
    Featured content text color
    Home intro background color
    Home intro text color
    Exhibit Builder navigation background
    Exhibit Builder navigation text

Omeka only supports hex codes for color values. For further reading and generation of hex color values, see http://htmlcolorcodes.com/.
Header and Footer

The theme supports an uploaded Logo File that replaces the site title text in the header. The logo will display at a maximum height of 48px in the header, meaning that if the uploaded logo file has a height larger than 48px, it will be scaled down automatically. By default, the header uses a black background, so transparent logos with light colors look best.

The Header Image is a persistent full-width banner that displays on every page above the content. The theme automatically sizes the header image to stretch across the page's width, so images with high width to height ratios are recommended.
Home

The homepage uses Omeka's "featured" flag as the source of its content. Featured content displays in the following order: featured exhibits, featured collections, and featured items. There are settings to toggle off any type of content (Display Featured Item, Display Featured Collection, Display Featured Exhibit). Within each content type, the ordering is random. Featured content that does not have an associated image uses a solid gray background. The theme automatically lays out the grid and supports an unlimited number of featured blocks.

Homepage Text provides a space for including introductory text. This text can be positioned above or below the featured content using Homepage Text Position.
